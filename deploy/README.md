## Docker Compose Deployment

This deployment scheme supports dual protocol access via HTTP/HTTPS, suitable for local development, testing, or lightweight production environment deployments.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS recommended) or macOS
- **Docker Engine**: 20.10.0+
- **Docker Compose**: v2.0.0+ (Docker Compose V2 plugin command `docker compose` is recommended)
- **Hardware Resources**:
  - CPU: 2 Core+
  - Memory: 4GB+
  - Disk: 10GB+

### Quick Start

#### 1. Get Code

```bash
# GitHub (International Network)
git clone https://github.com/Kymo-MCP/mcpcan-deploy.git
cd mcpcan-deploy/docker-compose

# Gitee (Recommended for China Network)
git clone https://gitee.com/kymomcp/mcpcan-deploy.git
cd mcpcan-deploy/docker-compose
```

#### 2. Preparation

1.  **Initialize Environment Configuration**:
    Copy the example environment file `example.env` to `.env`. This file contains all core configurations (such as ports, database passwords, version numbers, etc.).
    ```bash
    cp example.env .env
    ```
    *(Optional) Use a text editor (such as `vim` or `nano`) to modify the configuration in the `.env` file, for example, modifying the default port `MCP_ENTRY_SERVICE_PORT`.*

2.  **Generate Service Configuration**:
    Run the configuration generation script. This script will read variables from `.env` and generate the final configuration files into the `config/` directory based on templates in `config-template/`.
    ```bash
    chmod +x replace.sh
    ./replace.sh
    ```
    *Note: If you modify `.env` later, you must re-run this script to apply changes.*

#### 3. Start Services

Use Docker Compose to start all services. The first startup will automatically pull images and initialize the database.

```bash
docker compose up -d


# Default Login Credentials
Login: admin/admin123
```

**Startup Process Description**:
1.  **Base Service Startup**: MySQL and Redis start first.
2.  **Health Check**: Wait for MySQL and Redis status to become `healthy`.
3.  **Initialization**: The `mcp-init` container starts, executing database migration and seed data writing.
4.  **Core Service Startup**: After `mcp-init` **exits successfully**, core services such as `mcp-authz`, `mcp-market`, and `mcp-gateway` start.
5.  **Access Layer Startup**: Finally, `mcp-web` and `traefik` gateway start, providing services externally.

#### 4. Verify Installation

After the services start (usually takes 1-2 minutes), you can access via browser:

-   **Web Frontend**: [http://localhost](http://localhost) (or your configured HTTP port)
-   **HTTPS Access**: [https://localhost](https://localhost) (or your configured HTTPS port)
    -   *Note: Default uses a self-signed certificate; the browser will prompt it as insecure, please click "Proceed" to continue.*

Check running status:
```bash
docker compose ps
```
Ensure all service statuses are `Up` (or `Up (healthy)`), and `mcp-init` status is `Exited (0)`.

### Custom Configuration

#### Environment Variable Configuration

Main configurations are managed in the `.env` file. After modification, run `./replace.sh` to take effect.

| Variable Name | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `VERSION` | latest | Image version tag |
| `MCP_ENTRY_SERVICE_PORT` | 80 | HTTP access port |
| `MCP_ENTRY_SERVICE_HTTPS_PORT` | 443 | HTTPS access port |
| `MYSQL_PASSWORD` | (see file) | Database password |
| `RUN_MODE` | prod | Running mode (demo/prod) |

#### Configuration Hot Update

Generated configuration files are located in the `config/` directory.
-   **Temporary Modification**: Directly modify files under `config/`, restart relevant containers to take effect (running `./replace.sh` will overwrite this modification).
-   **Permanent Modification**: Modify template files under `config-template/`, then run `./replace.sh`.

### Common Maintenance Commands

The following commands need to be executed in the `docker-compose/` directory.

#### Update Image and Restart
Use when a new version image is released (modified `VERSION` in `.env`):
```bash
# 1. Pull latest images
docker compose pull

# 2. Recreate and start containers (only recreate changed containers)
docker compose up -d
```

#### Force Recreate Containers
If configuration files are modified or you want to completely reset container running status:
```bash
# --force-recreate Force destroy old containers and create new ones
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

#### Restart All Services
Only restart containers, do not delete containers, do not update images:
```bash
docker compose restart
```

#### Stop Services
```bash
# Stop and remove containers, networks (retain data volumes)
docker compose down
```

#### View Service Logs
```bash
# View all logs (Ctrl+C to exit)
docker compose logs -f

# View specific service logs (e.g., mcp-gateway)
docker compose logs -f mcp-gateway

# View initialization task logs (troubleshoot startup failures)
docker compose logs mcp-init
```

#### Clean Unused Images
Clean up old images no longer in use to free up disk space:
```bash
docker image prune -f
```

#### Completely Clean Environment (Use with Caution)
**Warning**: This operation will delete all containers, networks, and **persistent data** (database, uploaded files, etc.).
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./data
```

### Service Architecture

| Service Name | Description | Dependencies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **traefik** | Unified ingress gateway, handling HTTP/HTTPS routing | - |
| **mcp-init** | Initialization task (DB Migration/Seed), exits after completion | Depends on MySQL/Redis health |
| **mcp-authz** | Authentication and authorization service | Waits for mcp-init to complete |
| **mcp-market** | Plugin market core service | Waits for mcp-init to complete |
| **mcp-gateway** | API gateway service | Waits for mcp-init to complete |
| **mcp-web** | Frontend static resource service | Depends on backend service startup |

### Advanced Configuration

#### Certificate Replacement and Hot Loading

MCPCan supports TLS certificate dynamic hot loading without restarting services.

1.  Prepare certificate files (`.crt`, `.key`).
2.  Place certificates into the `certs/` directory.
3.  Modify certificate path configuration in `config/dynamic.yaml`.
4.  Traefik will automatically detect and apply new certificates.

### FAQ

**Q: Why do services like `mcp-market` stay in `Created` status and not start?**
A: This is a normal dependency waiting mechanism. They are configured with `condition: service_completed_successfully`, and must wait for the `mcp-init` container to successfully run and finish (Exit 0) before starting. Please check `mcp-init` logs to confirm if initialization was successful:
```bash
docker compose logs mcp-init
```

**Q: How to modify the database password?**
A: Modify `MYSQL_PASSWORD` in `.env`, then **must** delete old database data (`rm -rf data/mysql`), and re-run `./replace.sh && docker compose up -d`. Because MySQL only sets the password when initializing the data directory for the first time.

## Helm Quick Start

Suitable for Kubernetes environment deployment.

### Fast Install Script

This path automatically installs k3s, ingress-nginx, Helm, and deploys the MCPCAN platform; suitable for fresh environments without pre-installed Kubernetes components.

```bash
# 1. Switch to root directory
cd ..

# 2. Execute installation script
# Standard Fast Install (International Mirrors)
./scripts/install-fast.sh

# Fast Install (Accelerated with China Mirrors)
./scripts/install-fast.sh --cn
```

Upon success, the script verifies the Helm release status and prints the access URL.

For more Helm custom configurations and detailed instructions, please view the [Helm Chart Repository](https://kymo-mcp.github.io/mcpcan-deploy/).
